# Task 3 – Movie Rating Prediction with Python

## 🎯 Goal
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like **Genre, Director, and Actors**.  
This helps us understand which factors influence movie ratings and how to estimate ratings for new movies.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about Indian movies with the following columns:
- **Title** – Movie name
- **Genre** – Genre of the movie (e.g., Drama, Comedy, Action)
- **Director** – Name of the director
- **Actor 1, Actor 2, Actor 3** – Main cast members
- **IMDB Rating** – Target variable (rating of the movie)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data preprocessing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
